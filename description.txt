Welcome to the Loot Bags Mod!
This mod adds 5 different obtainable loot bags!

The loot (and the code) has been redone for 1.4! Go to the homepage for more info.
The aim of the mod is to give you occasional loot that may or may not be helpful. I tried to make it so the loot bags don't completely invalidate parts of the game. 

Tier 1 - Beginning of Game
Tier 2 - Post Skeletron
Tier 3 - Post WoF
Tier 4 - Post Plantera
Tier 5 - Post Moonlord

(NOT IN THIS VERSION) There are special weapons for each loot bag tier. The weapons get better as you go up the tiers.

Big Thanks to Xray299 and seabass927 for amazing sprites and suggestions!
