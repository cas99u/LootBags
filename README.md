# LootBags
Welcome to the Loot Bags Mod!
This mod adds 5 different obtainable loot bags!

The loot (and the code) has been redone for 1.4! The aim of the mod is to give you occasional loot that may or may not be helpful. I tried to make it so the loot bags don't completely invalidate parts of the game (lol jk). 

Loot bags have a chance to drop from random enemies. There are 5 tiers of loot bags:
```
Tier 1 - Beginning of Game
Tier 2 - Post-Skeletron
Tier 3 - Post-WoF
Tier 4 - Post-Plantera
Tier 5 - Post-Moonlord
```
Right clicking loot bags in the inventory will give you a random item. Your luck stat plays a role in the item drop chances, as reflected by the loot bag tool tips.

## Config
The Loot Bags config can be accessed from the ingame mod configuration (must be used from the main menu). The config can be used to edit the drop chances of each tier of loot bag. Drop chances are a fraction where the numerator is 1 and the number in the config is the denominator. For example, a value of 25 in the config translates to a 1/25 chance for the loot bag to drop when an enemy is killed.

## Changes from 1.3 to 1.4
- Tier 6 loot bag was removed due to the tier 4 bag being shifted to post-Plantera instead of post-Mech bosses
- Dye loot bag was removed because who actually cared about it 
- Loot Bag NPC was replaced with being able to craft previous loot bag tiers
- The loot drops from the bags were completely redone (along with the code)
- Loot Bag weapons were removed (might come back)
- Mod compatibility is currently unavailable
